# polynomials-fparsec

A simple parser and evaluator for polynomials expressions. For example it can parse expressions like:
* x+y^2
* 2*(x+1)

The solution uses [FParsec](https://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/) to implement a recursive descent parser. 

As examples of other approaches to the same problem, using C#:
